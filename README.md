 <center>                     
My self Rakesh Reddy, I am from Hyderabad,I was born in 1995.
I’m a Leo but I know it doesn’t mean anything. I’m 5’8. I hate my name but I love ‘M’. I have elder brother.
I’m an MBA graduate from osmania university.
I hate liars and smokers. i mostly say “Sorry” but I mean it when I say it. I say more “yes” than “no”. I used to dance when I was a kid. I rarely watch TV shows and but netfix is now my fav. Buying and driving mustang is my dream. 
My favorites change rarely… in fact very rarely. I have never read a book in my entire life. I love music, well this is about me .
